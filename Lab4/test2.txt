Class Material: File Transfer Using Sockets

Overview of File Transfer with TCP Sockets
    1. Server Responsibilities:
        ◦ Listen for incoming connections.
        ◦ Accept a client connection.
        ◦ Receive a file from the client in chunks.
        ◦ Save the file locally.
    2. Client Responsibilities:
        ◦ Connect to the server.
        ◦ Specify the file to upload.
        ◦ Send the file in chunks to the server.
        ◦ Notify the server when the transfer is complete.

How Does It Work?
    1. Server Initialization:
        ◦ Create a socket and bind it to a port.
        ◦ Listen for client connections.
        ◦ Accept a connection and handle data transmission.
    2. Client Communication:
        ◦ Establish a connection to the server.
        ◦ Send the file name and file data.
        ◦ Inform the server when the file transfer is complete.
    3. File Transfer Workflow:
        ◦ The client reads the file in chunks and sends each chunk to the server.
        ◦ The server receives the chunks and writes them to a local file.
        ◦ A special marker (EOF) indicates the end of the file transfer.
